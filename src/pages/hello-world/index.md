Hello world!

I created this blog as a jumping off point for my brainstorming. I never have been very good at writing down notes as I research, so I intend to use this blog to share what I come across and what conclusions I come up with.

I'm a full stack software engineer currently based out of Northwest Arkansas. Drop me a line!
