My personal blog. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `npm i`, then `npm run dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
